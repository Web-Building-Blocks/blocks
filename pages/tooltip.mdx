# Tooltip Component

**Contributed by Harrison**

A popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.

## Basic Tooltip Component (Right Tooltip)

Create a tooltip that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element. This tooltip text appears on the right direction.

<BasicTooltip />

## Variables

### Left Tooltip

The tooltip text appears on the left direction.

<LeftTooltip />

### Top Tooltip

The tooltip text appears on the top direction.

<TopTooltip />

### Bottom Tooltip

The tooltip text appears on the bottom direction.

<BottomTooltip />

### Disabled Tooltip

The disabled button with tooltip.

<DisabledTooltip />

### Animated Tooltip

The tooltip text with animation. Initially, the `opacity` of the tooltip text is set to 0, making it completely transparent and invisible. After one second (`transition: opacity 1s`), the tooltip text will change to `opacity 1`, making it fully visible.

## Usability

<details>
  <summary>Location of the tooltip</summary>
  The tooltip should not be placed in the place that will obscure other important
  elements. It should be intrusive. [USERWAY](https://userway.org/blog/your-guide-to-accessible-tooltips/)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Limit Word Counts</summary>
  Decrease the word count can provide user a more wonderful readable experience.
  If the word count is too large, we can distribute them into more tooltips. [USERWAY](https://userway.org/blog/your-guide-to-accessible-tooltips/)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use tooltip arrows when multiple elements are nearby</summary>
  Arrows can let users know which element belongs to that tooltip text. If no arrows,
  it can cause confusion for viewers. [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tooltip-guidelines/)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Use tooltips consistently throughout your site</summary>
  It's crucial to maintain consistency and offer tooltips for all of your design's
  components rather than just a select few. Use popup tips in place of further explanations
  for only part of the items. [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tooltip-guidelines/)
</details>

## Accessibility

<details>
  <summary>Focusable and Hoverable Tooltip</summary>
  All users must be able to engage tooltip triggers, hence they must be focusable
  and hoverable. When a tooltip is displayed, TooltipTrigger automatically links
  the tooltip to the trigger element so that the tooltip's content describes it.

<details>
  <summary>Use contrasting colors</summary>
  To guarantee that tooltips are the easiest for users of all skill levels to read
  against any background, there must be sufficient colour contrast. [USERWAY](https://userway.org/blog/your-guide-to-accessible-tooltips/)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Identify The Purpose Of Tooltip Component</summary>
  These attributes provide accessible labels for screen readers and assistive technologies
  to describe the purpose or function of the elements to users with disabilities.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard Interaction</summary>
  The user can display the tooltip text by pressing `Enter` on the keyboard, and
  press `ESC` to hide it. Many users, including some with visual or motor impairments,
  rely on keyboard navigation and operation. Using the keyboard to trigger tooltips
  allows these users to access additional information, improving accessibility.
