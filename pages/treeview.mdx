## Definition and Usage

**TreeView:**

-   **Definition:** A TreeView is a hierarchical list or tree structure that allows users to view, navigate, and select items from nested lists or categories.
-   **Usage:** Commonly used in file explorers, settings menus, and organizational charts. It provides a visual representation of hierarchical data, allowing users to expand or collapse branches to view or hide sub-items.

## Basic Component

<TreeView />

## Usability

### Intuitive Hierarchical Structure

A well-designed tree view component should present data in a clear and intuitive hierarchical structure. Users should easily understand the relationships between parent and child items, enhancing usability.

### Expand and Collapse Functionality

Usability is improved when users can expand and collapse tree nodes to reveal or hide sub-level information. This feature simplifies navigation within large data sets.

### Drag-and-Drop Support

The ability to drag and drop items within the tree view enhances usability, allowing users to reorder or organize items effortlessly.

### User-Friendly Icons and Symbols

Icons or symbols used to represent different types of tree nodes should be easily understandable, aiding usability. For example, using a folder icon for directories is a widely recognized convention.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation is critical for accessibility. All interactive elements, including tree nodes and expand/collapse controls, should be operable using keyboard commands.
