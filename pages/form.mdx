## Usability

### Keep it short

<details>
  <summary>Keep it short</summary>
  The mathematician Blaise Pascal famously said: “I have made this longer than usual
  because I have not had time to make it shorter.” This principle applies to web
  forms as well as prose writing. Eliminating unnecessary fields requires more time,
  but the reduced user effort and increased completion rates make it worthwhile.
  Remove fields which collect information that can be (a) derived in some other way,
  (b) collected more conveniently at a later date, or (c) simply omitted. (We recently
  applied this technique to one of our own forms and reduced it from 6 fields down
  to only 2 fields.) Every time you cut a field or question from a form, you increase
  its conversion rate — the business case for this guideline is that simple. [Nielsen
  Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Visually group related labels and fields

<details>
  <summary>Visually group related labels and fields</summary>
  Labels should be close to the fields they describe (immediately above the field
  for mobile and shorter desktop forms, or next to the field for extremely long desktop
  forms). Avoid ambiguous spacing, where labels are equidistant from multiple fields,
  and make sure to include the label attribute for screen readers. If your form asks
  about two different topics, section it into two separate groups of fields (and
  tag the groups for screen readers). [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Present fields in a single column layout

<details>
  <summary>Present fields in a single column layout</summary>
  Multiple columns interrupt the vertical momentum of moving down the form. Rather
  than requiring users to visually reorient themselves, keep them in the flow by
  sticking to a single column with a separate row for each field. (Exceptions to
  this rule: short and/or logically related fields such as City, State, and Zip Code
  can be presented on the same row.) [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Use logical sequencing

<details>
  <summary>Use logical sequencing</summary>
  Stick to standard sequences both for fields (e.g., Credit-card number, Expiration
  date, Security code) and for value choices (e.g., Standard shipping, 2-day shipping,
  1-day shipping). But for field values, also consider usage frequency, and list
  the most common values first when possible. [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Distinguish optional and required fields

<details>
  <summary>Distinguish optional and required fields</summary>
  First, eliminate as many optional fields as possible (see the first recommendation
  above). If some fields truly are necessary, but only apply to a subset of users,
  don’t make users find out through trial and error. Limit the form to only 1 or
  2 optional fields, and clearly label them as optional.[Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Use Animation or Visual Feedback

<details>
  <summary>Use Animation or Visual Feedback</summary>
  If a field requires a specific format or type of input, state the exact instructions.
  Don’t make users guess your obscure password requirements. The same applies to
  syntax rules such as punctuation or spacing for phone numbers or credit cards.
  (Though as much as possible you should eliminate these arbitrary formatting rules:
  death to parentheses for phone-number area codes!)[Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)
</details>

### Avoid Reset and Clear buttons

<details>
  <summary>Avoid Reset and Clear buttons</summary>
  The risk of accidental deletion outweighs the unlikely need to ‘start over’ on
  a web form. In forms that collect extremely sensitive input such as financial information,
  provide a ‘Cancel’ button to support those users who abandon the form and want
  to delete their information. But make sure that the Cancel button has significantly
  less visual prominence than the Submit button, to avoid accidental clicks.[Nielsen
  Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interaction

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard Interaction</summary>
  Keyboards are used by people with vision or mobility impairments to browse internet
  forms. Users can switch between links and form controls by using the `tab` key.
  Because it's quicker and easier on the hands than using a mouse, some people, irrespective
  of their level of competence, prefer to navigate this way.
</details>

### Use A Clear Visual Label—Not Placeholder Text

<details>
  <summary>Use A Clear Visual Label—Not Placeholder Text</summary>
  Visually impaired people often have trouble reading it since there is low contrast
  between the text color and the form field background. Plus, screen readers often
  don’t detect placeholder text. This design also strains short-term memory since
  the text disappears once the user selects the field. These temporary instructions
  are frustrating for just about everyone. It’s easy to forget the text, especially
  if you’re in a frenzy of online multitasking (how many browser tabs do you have
  open right now?). Instead, include a clear visual label above form fields. Continuing
  with our previous example, insert “phone number” above the form. [Meredith Grace
  Kucherov](https://formspree.io/blog/accessible-forms/)
</details>

### Provide Instructions For Screen Readers With ARIA Labels

<details>
  <summary>Provide Instructions For Screen Readers With ARIA Labels</summary>
  ARIA—Accessible Rich Internet Applications—is a set of related HTML attributes
  that includes instructions and information for screen readers. These attributes,
  such as aria-label and aria-labeledby, don’t display anything on the web page.
  Per WebAIM, ARIA should only be used when native HTML is not sufficiently clear.
  ARIA attributes are essential when they provide information that someone relying
  on a screen reader needs to hear to understand the form. [Meredith Grace Kucherov](https://formspree.io/blog/accessible-forms/)
