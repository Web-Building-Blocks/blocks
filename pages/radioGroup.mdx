# Radio Group Component

**Contributed by Harrison**

A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same `name`. Using radio buttons, users may select only one option from a collection of mutually incompatible options.

## Basic Radio Group Component

This HTML code is for the user to select their favorite pet. It provides three radio buttons for different pet choices: dogs, cats, and birds.

This JavaScript code adds an event listener to the form's submit event. When the user submits the form, it captures the data using `FormData`. After looping over each form entry, the key-value pairs are then combined to create a string. This string is then displayed in the element with the id `log`. The `event.preventDefault()` prevents the default form submission behavior.

## Usability

### Options Should Be Comprehensive and Clearly Distinct

  Vague or misleading labels will let users be confused. Using the obvious and intuitive
  label can increase the usability. [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/radio-buttons-default-selection/)

### Always Offer a Default Selection

  <summary>Always Offer a Default Selection</summary>
  The ability for users to undo and redo their actions is one of the ten UI design
  criteria. This entails allowing users to restore UI controls to their initial settings.
  This implies that radio buttons should always have precisely one choice pre-selected
  in the case of radio buttons. Choose the one that is the safest and most secure
  to avoid data loss. Checked attribute can set one option to be default. [Nielsen

### Lay Out Your Lists Vertically

  Users are more used to view the radio buttons vertically. When viewing horizontal
  radio buttons, users will encounter problems. [babich.biz](https://babich.biz/radio-buttons-ux-design/)

### Use Label Tags as Click Targets

  Larger target area for users to tap can increase usability. Not only let them click
  the circle button but also click the label. [babich.biz](https://babich.biz/radio-buttons-ux-design/)

### Avoid Nesting

### Use Animation or Visual Feedback

  Allow users to have post-click feedback after clicking the radio button. Don't
  let them not know that they have clicked.

  By using keyboard, users can more easily navigate and select options instead of
  relying solely on mouse actions. Moreover, we ensure that our page adheres to accessibility
  guidelines and makes it easy for users with disabilities to access and use the
  radio group. Users can press `up` and `down` key to move the selected option.
