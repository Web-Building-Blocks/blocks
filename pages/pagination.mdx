# Pagination Component

**Contributed by Ke Louis Liu**

## Definition and Usage

**Pagination:**

-   **Definition:** Pagination is a technique used to divide large sets of data into smaller, manageable chunks, presented across multiple pages.
-   **Usage:** Commonly used in search results, product listings, and content archives. It helps improve the user experience by limiting the number of items displayed on a single page, providing navigation controls to move between pages.

## Basic Component

<Pagination />

## Usability

### Intuitive Navigation

Pagination should offer clear and intuitive navigation between different pages of content. Users should easily understand how to move between pages, whether through numeric page links, previous/next buttons, or other methods.

### Page Size Control

Usability is enhanced when users have the option to control the number of items displayed per page. This flexibility allows users to tailor their browsing experience to their preferences.

### Previous and Next Buttons

Providing previous and next buttons simplifies navigation, especially when there are many pages. Users should be able to move forward and backward easily.

### Responsive Design

Usability is improved when the pagination component adapts to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring that it remains functional and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Current Page Highlight

Highlighting or visually indicating the current page in the pagination component helps users maintain context within a larger dataset.

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Interaction

Make sure that keyboard users can use standard keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Tab, Enter, Space) to navigate and activate pagination controls.

### Color and Contrast

Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast between pagination text and background to meet accessibility guidelines, making it easier for users with visual impairments to read the content.
