**Contributed by Chaoyang Li**

## Variants

<WithDividers />

### With icons

### With header
A Simple header in the dropdown can show the current status. The select tag doesn't support this requirement.

## Usability

<details>
    <summary>Include a label</summary>
    Every picker should have a label. A picker without a label is ambiguous and not accessible.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Keep menu items concise</summary>
    Keep menu items short and concise. Long menu items that cause text to wrap to multiple lines are discouraged. If text wrapping becomes a frequent concern, consider revising the text or use alternative UI patterns that will give your content more space.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Choose an appropriate width</summary>
    When possible, the field button width should be wide enough so that any chosen menu items can be displayed in full.
