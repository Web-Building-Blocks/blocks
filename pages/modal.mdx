# Modal Component

**Contributed by Richard Lee**

## Introduction

The **Blocks** **`Modal`** component is a simple modal that can be used to display a message or a form. The component is fully customisable with the ability to change the title, body, and buttons. It is also responsive and has a mobile view.

The design philosophy of the **`Modal`** component is to be as simple as possible. It is not meant to be a full-featured modal component. Instead as previously mentioned, it is meant to be a simple modal component that can be used to display a message or a form and at the same time, be fully customisable.

The **`Modal`** component is designed for both mobile and desktop. It is responsive and will adjust to the screen size.

The **`Modal`** component has the following optional properties:

- **title** - the title of the modal
- **body** - the body of the modal
- **buttons** - an array of buttons to be displayed in the modal
- **show** - a boolean value that determines whether the modal is shown
- **hidden** - a boolean value that determines whether the modal is closed

## Simple Modal

The **`Simple Modal`** component contains a title, body, and buttons. The title and body are optional. The buttons are an array of buttons to be displayed in the modal, and they are also optional. We designed this component so that it can be used to showcase the simple message and for the user to decide on their response to the message.

You can configure the **`Simple Modal`** component by filling in the properties listed in the **`Introduction`** section.

## Simple Modal With Picture

The **`Simple Modal With Picture`** component is a variation of the **`Simple Modal`** component. This means it was built on top of the **`Simple Modal`** component. The **`Simple Modal With Picture`** component also contains a title, body, and buttons. The title and body are optional. The buttons are an array of buttons to be displayed in the modal. And they are also optional.

You can configure the **`Simple Modal With Picture`** component by filling in the properties listed in the **`Introduction`** section.

The **`Confirm`** component is a specialised modal designed for confirming actions. It provides a clear way for users to confirm or cancel an action before proceeding. The component inherits the basic modal structure and allows customisation of the confirmation message and button labels.

The **`Confirm`** component supports the following properties:

- **Title** - the title of the modal

## Login Modal

The **`Login`** component is a specialised modal designed for user authentication. It provides fields for the user to input their credentials and login to the system. The component inherits the basic modal structure and allows customisation of the login form and button labels.

In our example, we have used the **`Login`** component to create a simple login form for the **`University of Sydney Student`** Login. The form has two fields, one for the **`UniKey`** and one for the **`Password`**. The form also has a button to handle the login action.

The **`Login`** component supports the following properties:

## Usability

The **`Modal`** component is designed to be responsive and will adjust to the screen size. This component is designed to be used in a variety of situations, and we have followed the official guidelines from W3 to design this component.

The **`Modal`** component is a simple yet powerful component. Specifically, it is great for displaying a simple message or a form to the user. It is also fully customisable, which means the developer can change the title, body, and buttons to suit their needs.

For example, when the developer wants to display a simple message to the user, they can use the **`Simple Modal`** component. When the developer wants to display a simple message with a picture to the user, they can use the **`Simple Modal With Picture`** component. So on and so forth.

The font used in this component is `Inter`, which is a font designed for screens. It is a sans-serif font that is easy to read on screens. You can find the font in the `link` tag in the `head` tag of the `index.html` file.

All images in the example include `alt` tags, which is a requirement for accessibility. The `alt` tag is used to describe the image to the users, and it is used by screen readers to describe the image to the users. We strongly recommend the `alt` tags not be deleted or modified when using this component code.

Please include the following HTML code in the `head` tag of your `index.html` file to ensure the component is responsive, this is a requirement for accessibility and is recommended by W3:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```
