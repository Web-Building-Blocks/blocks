<Table />

### Usability

1. **Simplicity and Readability**: 
   - The design is straightforward with easily understood headings and list items that outline the features of each pricing plan.
   - The use of `h2` and `h3` tags helps create a hierarchy of information, making it more digestible.

2. **Consistency**: 
   - Each pricing card follows the same structure and layout, making it easier for users to compare them side by side.

3. **Clear CTAs (Call to Action)**: 
   - Each card has a single, clear action button labeled "Subscribe," making it evident what users are supposed to do next.

4. **Responsive Design**: 
   - The CSS includes a media query that adjusts the layout for screens less than 768px wide.
   - This makes the design usable across various devices.

### Accessibility

1. **Semantic HTML**: 
   - The use of semantic tags like `h2`, `h3`, and `ul` not only benefits SEO but also screen readers.
   - It helps to convey the structure of the content.

2. **Color Contrast**: 
   - The button's color scheme (blue background and white text) provides good contrast.
   - This makes it more readable for people with vision impairments.

3. **Keyboard Navigation**: 
   - Standard HTML elements like buttons are used, which are naturally focusable and accessible through keyboard navigation.

4. **Text Size**: 
   - The font sizes for `h2` and `h3` are larger than the default, improving readability for all users, including those with low vision.
