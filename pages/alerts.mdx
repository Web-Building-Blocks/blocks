## Usability

<details>
    <summary>Make alert banners actionable</summary>
    Whenever possible, add action button if there's a way for a user to quickly address the issue associated with an alert.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Consider including a close button</summary>
    The close button is optional, depending on context. Consider adding one to let a user easily dismiss the alert.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Use the color appropriately</summary>
    Don’t use yellow or orange colors for errors because the contrast is not accessible.
    If you need to show a “notice” message or other non-critical communication, use the blue (informative) semantic color options. Reserve the red (negative) option only for errors that directly interrupt or block a user’s experience — not for nice-to-know information.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Place alert banners at the top</summary>
    Alert banners should appear at the top of a page.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Don't stack alert banners</summary>
    Don't show multiple alert banners at the same time. If a new alert appears with a higher priority message, it should replace an existing alert of lesser importance until the higher priority one has been addressed.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Overlay content</summary>
    Overlay an alert when it's expected to fade in and out without impacting the content underneath it, and when it's not hiding any important actions or information by being there. An alert should only overlay content if it is dismissible.
</details>

## Accessibility

### Add Sound when alert are triggered
For some visually impaired people, adding a corresponding prompt sound to ensure that the visually impaired users are aware the alerts and improve their fluency in using the webpage.
<SoundAlert />
