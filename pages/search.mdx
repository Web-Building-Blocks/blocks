# Search Component

**Contributed by Harrison**

Search component is an input component that can provide users to type words in the search bar and then by clicking the search button, user can get the corresponding results.

## Basic Search Component

This is the most basic search component.

## Usability

<details>
  <summary>Put Search Component in the appropriate place</summary>
  If people set a search box in the upper-right or upper-center region of your layout,
  they can be sure that users will locate it there because users expect it will be
  placed there.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Make Search Component simple</summary>
  Simple search box is more usable and obvious for users. Advanced search box will
  make users confused.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Appropriate Serach Component Size</summary>
  As a general guideline, keep text input to 27 characters or less (this would accommodate
  90% of enquiries). [Nielsen Norman](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/top-ten-guidelines-for-homepage-usability/)
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Autocomplete And Suggestions</summary>
  Provide suggestions for user searching, so that users have a better experience
  and reduce the occurrence of input errors and reduce the time searching for the
  same things.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint for the search component</summary>
  Using the placeholder attribute can give users a clearer understanding of what
  to do to avoid making mistakes.
</details>

## Accessibility

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard Interaction</summary>
  Let the users submit search by using `enter` on the keyboard or clicking the search
  button. The `Tab` key on a keyboard should allow users to move between the search
  box and other areas.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Keyboard Shortcut</summary>
  Allowing users to use shortcuts to achieve their goals can improve the user experience
  and enable them to search using keyboard shortcuts, improving website accessibility.
  For the code, we can press `CTRL` and `K` simultaneously to trigger the focus function.
  We can see that the border change the color to purple and we can directly type
  words in the search bar.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Identify The Purpose Of Search Component</summary>
  The text input field should have a label identifying its functionality. By adding
  these aria-label characteristics, we may improve accessibility by giving these
  crucial page elements clear, illuminating labels. They make sure that visitors,
  especially those who use screen readers, can more easily comprehend the elements
  and their purposes, promoting simpler interaction and navigation on the website.

## Search Attributes

Here is a table describing some common attributes for the HTML search component.

| Attribute   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| list        | The values of the list attribute is the `id` of a `<datalist>` element located in the same document. The `<datalist>` provides a list of predefined values to suggest to the user for this input. Any values in the list that are not compatible with the `type` are not included in the suggested options. The values provided are suggestions, not requirements: users can select from this predefined list or provide a different value.                                                                          |
| maxlength   | The maximum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user can enter into the search field. This must be an integer value of 0 or higher. If no `maxlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the search field has no maximum length. This value must also be greater than or equal to the value of `minlength`.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| minlength   | The minimum string length (measured in UTF-16 code units) that the user can enter into the search field. This must be a non-negative integer value smaller than or equal to the value specified by `maxlength`. If no `minlength` is specified, or an invalid value is specified, the search input has no minimum length.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| pattern     | The `pattern` attribute, when specified, is a regular expression that the input's `value` must match for the value to pass constraint validation. It must be a valid JavaScript regular expression, as used by the `RegExp` type, and as documented in our guide on regular expressions; the `'u'` flag is specified when compiling the regular expression so that the pattern is treated as a sequence of Unicode code points, instead of as ASCII. No forward slashes should be specified around the pattern text. |
| placeholder | The `placeholder` attribute is a string that provides a brief hint to the user as to what kind of information is expected in the field. It should be a word or short phrase that demonstrates the expected type of data, rather than an explanatory message. The text must not include carriage returns or line feeds.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| readonly    | A Boolean attribute which, if present, means this field cannot be edited by the user. Its `value` can, however, still be changed by JavaScript code directly setting the `HTMLInputElement` `value` property.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| size        | The `size` attribute is a numeric value indicating how many characters wide the input field should be. The value must be a number greater than zero, and the default value is 20. Since character widths vary, this may or may not be exact and should not be relied upon to be so; the resulting input may be narrower or wider than the specified number of characters, depending on the characters and the font (`font` settings in use).                                                                         |
| spellcheck  | spellcheck is a global attribute which is used to indicate whether to enable spell checking for an element. It can be used on any editable content, but here we consider specifics related to the use of spellcheck on `<input>` elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
